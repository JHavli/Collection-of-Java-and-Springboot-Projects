# Portfolio - A Collection of Java and Spring Boot based projects

1) BLOG: 

This Java project aims to provide an efficient and organized system for managing blog posts and websites using OOP concepts.

2) BmiCalculator: 

A simple App to calculate the BMI of my family members and me.

3) Chitter: 

This Spring Boot project uses a MongoDB repository to allow users to save new tweets, display all existing tweets from the latest to the earliest, display existing tweets from a specific user, like an existing tweet, and add comments to an existing tweet. The project will utilize Spring Boot's capabilities to create a RESTful API that interacts with the MongoDB database, allowing users to easily interact with the application. The API will support CRUD operations for tweets, including the ability to filter by user and includes the ability to add likes and comments to tweets.

4) FilmListReplacer: 

This Spring Boot app combines three web applications: recommendations, tailored recommendations, and red hot movies. This app is designed to follow the graceful degradation technique in the face of system failures: The user will receive a film list (red hot movies) even if the services of the app are not available.
